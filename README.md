# EV.MODULO.01-ARELLIS
Hi!
I’m Arellis Quispe, and this is my README for the first evaluation exercise of Module 1 in ADALAB’s Data Analytics Bootcamp.
The goal of this exercise is to create a class that works as a blueprint to build our own shop. This will help us identify the areas we need to improve in our learning process.
OnlineShop is the class I created to build my own store: Grafiito. While working on this exercise and reviewing the topics, I was surrounded by markers and pens, which inspired me to make the shop about stationery items.
Let's get to work!
